# Below is the explanation of spinning.sh script:
#a. The spin variable contains a string composed of four characters: -, \, |, and /.
# When printed sequentially in a loop, these characters create a console animation that resembles a spinning line or wheel. 
# This effect is achieved through the illusion of motion created by the sequence and orientation of these characters.
#b. The line while [[ true ]]; do signifies an infinite loop.
# The code block declared inside the loop repeats from top to bottom infinitely.
#c. printf prints the \r character, causing the text to print at the same position each time.
#d. The script uses printf to expand the ${spin} variable with a specific technique that involves an arithmetic expansion calculating the modulo of i % 4. 
#This calculation determines the position of each character in the spin variable. 
#Here’s how it works:
# (i) 0 modulo 4 asks, “What is the remainder when 0 is divided by 4?” Since 0 divided by any number is 0, the remainder is also 0. So, 0 modulo 4 equals 0.
# (ii) 1 modulo 4 asks, “What is the remainder when 1 is divided by 4?” Since 1 is less than 4, it can’t be divided by 4 without a remainder. Therefore, the entire number 1 is the remainder. So, 1 modulo 4 equals 1.
# Continuing this pattern:
# * 2 modulo 4 equals 2 (2 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2).
# * 3 modulo 4 equals 3 (3 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3).
# * 4 modulo 4 equals 0 (4 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 0, as 4 is evenly divisible by 4).
# * Finally, we have a colon : and a number 1, which extracts a substring to print one character at a time.
# This technique is quite common in Bash and is often used to create the popular spinning wheel animation. Feel free to use this script in your future endeavours.
