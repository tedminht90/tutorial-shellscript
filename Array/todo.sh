# In your home directory (/home/bob), you will find a directory named script which has a script called todo.sh. Running the script prompts the user to enter items, which get stored in an array.

# Modify the todo.sh script to print all items in the array once youâ€™ve stopped inputting new ones.

# Test the script using these inputs:

# Meditate
# Hydrate
# Work
# Study
# Exercise
# Sleep

# Remember to type stop when you are done adding items to the array.

# Execute the script to ensure your changes work fine.




#!/bin/bash

  if [[ "${todo}" == "stop" ]]; then

echo "Current todo list: ${todo_list[@]}"

#After the array is printed, add a line of code that deletes all of the elements except the last one, from the array, and then print the array again to demonstrate how the lines were deleted.
